# Boost-Document-Search-Engine
### synopsis
Boost-C++ LIBRARIES is a third-party library of C++, and boost library is a very powerful library. In the future development trend of C++, I think boost may be added to the standard library of C++, but the boost website does not have the function of searching documents, so it is a project. This project is a search engine for basic boost documents. When a user enters a query word, the relevant document pages of this key word can be found out, and the purpose of searching documents has been achieved.

### Ending
Because of poverty, no cloud server has been purchased, so the front-end has not been developed yet.

But it's coming soon.
